This is an Attack at 7+. If it succeeds, the unit charges half its Maximum Movement distance prior to the enemy unit's own charge into contact and both count as Attacking. If it fails, it stands in place for the enemy's charge and counts as Defending as normal. Counter-Charge may not be used if the unit is Suppressed.",
